            <h1>Who is Cécile & Why is She Contacting Us?</h1>
            <h2>I'm a student in search of an apprenticeship</h2>
            <p id="aboutText">
                Telling stories has always been my passion. I studied film, but kept gravitating towards sketching and painting.
                <br><br>Today I’ve realized that my calling is in the digital realm of visual storytelling. After this epipfany I've embarked on a new education in Digital Media at Roskilde Technical School.<br><br>In order to furfill my new education
                I'll need an apprenticeship.
                <br><br>I don’t regret getting my master’s in Film and Media studies; there I've learned invaluable lessons on visual communication and narratives.
                <br><br>Now I hope to use and develop this knowlegde during an apprenticship in an awesome company such as yours!
